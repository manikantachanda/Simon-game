# Simon-game
This is a single player game in which different sounds will be played in order and we have to memorize the order for every level starting from first level and we have to tap the buttons in the same order in order to go to the next level. If we tap the buttons in the wrong order the game ends.
For this I have used HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT.
